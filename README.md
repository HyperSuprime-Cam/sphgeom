sphgeom: spherical geometry primitives
======================================

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/lsst/sphgeom.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/lsst/sphgeom)

Overview
--------

This low-level C++ library provides primitives for representing regions on the
unit  sphere, as well as rudimentary support for partitioning the sphere into
smaller pieces. It can answer questions like
  - *Is point X inside region Y?*
  - *Do two regions A and B intersect?*
  - *Which pieces of the sphere does region C overlap?*

Typical Usage
